# Onion-Scraper

If you're doing web crawling for your own purposes, it is legal as it falls under fair use doctrine. The complications start if you want to use scraped data for others, especially commercial purposes.

<b>#What is darkweb?</b>

The dark web refers to content that isn't indexed by search engines and that requires special software or authorization to access. Dark web content lives on the darknet, a part of the internet accessible only to particular browsers or through specific network configurations
